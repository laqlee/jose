Bible Study: (5 min.) lff lesson 05 point 6 and Some People Say

June 22, 2022

Laquelle:
This next section of the lesson describes the Bible as "a book for all people".
It says the Bible is the most widely translated and distributed book in history.
Jose, would you like to read Acts 10:34, 35?

Jose:
[Read Acts 10:34, 35]

Laquelle:
Why does God want his Word to be so widely translated and distributed?

Jose:
The Bible is God's way of communicating with us.
Acts 10:34 says that God is not partial.
So Jehovah wants his message to be heard by all people so that they may benefit from his message, which teaches us how we may get to know him and live in a way that is acceptable to him.

Laquelle:
Yes, very good.
What appeals to you about the Bible?

Jose:
The Bible is not just for people of one particular nation or language.
It is not meant to be read only by certain people.
Its message is for everyone.

Laquelle:
How does it make you feel that the Bible is available to you.

Jose:
I'm happy that the Bible is translated in a language that I understand and made available to me so that I can study it, learn from it, and benefit from it.
I can see that Jehovah really wants me to hear his message and get to know him.

Laquelle:
Exactly.
Let's take a look at the picture here.
What do you notice in this picture?

Jose:
I see many people reading the Bible.

Laquelle:
Would you say they are from the same country?

Jose:
They appear to be from different countries.
And they are reading the Bible in their own language.

Laquelle:
What do you see at the bottom of the picture?

Jose:
I see a line of Bibles in various formats that have existed throughout history.
The Bible started out as scrolls.
And eventually books were produced, and now the Bible is available in digital format.

Laquelle:
Yes, so as illustrated here, we see that the Bible really is for all people.
It has been made accessible to almost everyone, no matter where they live or what language they speak.
Now let's look at these statistics here.
What jumps out at you among these stats?

Jose:
I see a big number, 5 billion, which is the estimated number of copies produced.

Laquelle:
Yes, far more than any other book.
It also says the Bible is available in over 3,000 languages in whole or in part.
So nearly 100% of the world's population have access to the Bible in a language they understand.
So we really appreciate how Jehovah made sure his message would reach people all around the world.
Let's consider this next part, what some people say.
"The Bible is just an old book written by humans."
What do you think?

Jose:
The Bible is a book that contains God's message.
Jehovah used humans to write the Bible.
He used his holy spirit to inspire them to record his thoughts.
We can think of the writers as human secretaries, but the message came from God.

Laquelle:
What evidence suggests that the Bible is God's Word?

Jose:
If the Bible is from God, we would expect him to preserve it.
Throughout history, powerful people have tried to destroy the Bible.
There was a lot of resistence to having the Bible accessible by the general people.
Yet despite intense opposition, the Bible survives to this day.
And it is the most widely translated and distributed book in history.
This tells me that Jehovah is the author of the Bible.

Laquelle:
It is amazing to think about what the Bible has gone through to reach us.
Like you said, there have been efforts to limit the availability of the Bible by preventing its translation.
People have even been executed for translating and distributing the Bible.
So we appreciate how Jehovah made sure to preserve his Word so that we may benefit from his message.
Let's move on to the summary and review for this lesson.
